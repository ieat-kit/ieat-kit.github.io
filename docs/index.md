# About us

We are a group of staff members at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) committed to ensuring research collaborations align with principles of justice and international law. As members of the academic community, we believe it is our responsibility to examine the ethical implications of institutional partnerships and to advocate for transparency, accountability, and compliance with international legal standards. Our aim is also to create a space for informed discussion, bringing together scholars, students, and staff to engage in constructive dialogue on the role of academia in upholding human rights and ethical research practices.

The current focus of our initiative lies on calling for a legal and ethical review of collaborations between KIT and Israeli research institutions (see [our letter]), as well as to cut ties with institutions that are found to be complicit in the ongoing and decades long record of violation of human rights of the Palestinian people. Our focus on Israeli institutions stems from the fact that among KIT's partner institutions, they stand out in that there is significant evidence they collaborate with a government and military found to be plausibly committing genocide and maintaining an illegal occupation.
