# Our Letter

To the _KIT_ executive board,  
 To the members of the _KIT_ senate,  
 To the members of the _KIT_ ethics commission,

The Guidelines for Ethical Principles of _KIT_ set out the obligations of every member of _KIT_, and also define the basis of cooperation with partners of KIT[^1]. Within the ethical principles it reads:
 
> "We assume responsibility for our acting and for the consequences of our actions. Our work shall serve the gaining of knowledge, the sustainable benefit of mankind, and the protection of the environment and shall pursue peaceful purposes. "

In addition, the Principle of Action also requires _KIT_ members:

> "to minimize... the risk of misuse by an adequate selection of our... cooperation partners ..." and "...to ultimately abstain from research activities that are associated with risks that cannot be restricted."

This letter highlights evidence demonstrating that cooperation agreements with Israeli universities violate these fundamental ethical principles due to their complicity in Israel’s long-standing violation of Palestinian human rights. Our demands for _KIT_ to act in accordance with its own ethical principles are outlined at the end of this letter and are based on the provided evidence.

## The Context

On request for Advisory Opinion to the _United Nations (UN) General Assembly_, the _International Court of Justice (ICJ)_ overwhelmingly ruled on the 19th July 2024 that Israel is committing the crime of racial segregation and apartheid and that its occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal under international law. Israel must end its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as quickly as possible[^2]. Importantly, the _ICJ_ ruling also sets out the legal obligation to end complicity in Israel’s illegal occupation and segregation policies. Ending decades of illegal occupation of Palestinian lands remains central to stopping the cycle of recurrent violence, according to international human rights experts mandated by the _UN Human Rights Council_[^3]. The historic denial of Palestinian self-determination further forms the background against which current atrocities in Gaza are unfolding[^4].

Israel’s latest military operation in the occupied and besieged Gaza Strip started in response to an attack committed by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on October 7th 2023, which included the killing of more than 1,105 Israeli citizens and foreign nationals, as well as the abduction of 250 people as hostages[^5][^6]. Within days, the Israeli military response was internationally criticized by human rights experts for its disproportionate retaliatory nature and mass killing of Palestinian civilians[^7][^8][^9][^10][^11]. More than a year into the military operation, a further 512 Israelis have been killed by Hamas and Hezbollah[^6]. Meanwhile the onslaught on Gaza by the Israeli military has killed at least 40,738 Palestinians, displaced 1.9 million people and led to an imminent risk of famine, where 95% of the population in the Gaza Strip are facing high acute food insecurity[^5][^12]. Over a year of bombing has almost entirely eradicated the infrastructure of the Gaza Strip, with at least 92% of roads and 84% of health facilities damaged or destroyed[^13]. The Israeli offensive has also led to a systematic assault on academic institutions, where today all higher education facilities in Gaza are either severely damaged as a result of Israeli bombing or have been obliterated by the Israeli military[^14][^15][^16][^17][^18][^19].

Alongside the attacks on universities and the killing of at least 94 university employees[^20], the Israeli military has so far damaged over 524 schools: more than 90% of all schools in Gaza[^12]. Collectively, the targeted destruction of university and school buildings, and the killing of its faculty and staff, have severely impaired the entire educational sector in Gaza[^21][^22]. In reaction to the scale of destruction of Palestinian life and culture, the heads of 15 Palestinian universities underlined the complicity of Israeli universities in Israel’s crimes against Palestinians and called for them to “face international isolation”[^23]. Together with human rights experts of the _UN_[^24], the Palestinian university administrations have warned that the assault on the educational sector is part of a larger campaign intending to destroy the foundations of continued Palestinian life in Gaza. A warning that is mirrored in South Africa’s genocide case against Israel before the _ICJ_[^25]. In response to South Africa’s allegations[^26], the _ICJ_ has found already in January 2024 a plausible risk that Israel is committing Genocide in Gaza[^27]. Since then, the _United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967_, Francesca Albanese, concluded in her latest report that the threshold indicating Israel's commission of a Genocide in Gaza has been met[^4].

In light of these catastrophic developments, it is our obligation to call out the complicity of Israeli Universities in Israel’s ongoing violation of Palestinian rights and international law by actively supporting the Israeli government and its military.

It is further our responsibility to remind _KIT_ of its legal responsibility, as a state institution, to avoid aiding and assisting in the commission of Israel’s serious international law breaches, including via institutional cooperation with complicit Israeli universities[^39].

The involvement of Israeli universities in Israel’s systematic oppression of Palestinians, long documented by Palestinian scholars and human rights organizations, is increasingly a topic of scholarly research[^28][^29]. All public universities in Israel offer specialized military degree-granting programs[^28], educating and training Israeli soldiers before or even during their active military service, where they are mainly deployed to maintain the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands, in military offensives that violate international law[^2][^30]. These programs are run and financed by the Israeli military and the Ministry of Defense, dissolving the boundaries between military training bases and Israeli university campuses[^28]. Some notable examples include the _Atuda_ (academic reserve) program running across many universities, developed to offer the military a highly educated and specialized cadre of soldiers, _Ben-Gurion University_’s accelerated bachelor program for fighter pilots designed to complement their professional training, the _Alonium_ program at _Technion_ training soldiers in data science, the _Talpiot_ program at _Hebrew university_ for technological research on weapons systems of the Israeli military, and the _Havatzalot_ and _Gamla_ programs at _Hebrew University_ for training officers in the Israeli Intelligence services[^28].

Israeli universities not only train active soldiers and security state personnel as students, but offer their campuses, resources, students, and faculty to aid in the development of technology and weaponry deployed against Palestinians[^28][^31]. Israeli universities have always closely cooperated with Israel’s military industries, which serve the Israeli military as their primary client. Further, university research is heavily funded and advanced by the Israeli security state and Israeli weapons corporations[^32]. _KIT_’s official partner university in Israel, _Technion_[^33], maintains close ties with multiple Israeli weapons corporations via joint research and development programs[^28][^34]. Israeli universities also operate technological parks, where the application of their research is translated into innovations for the Israeli military industry. One such park, _Kiryat Weizmann_, operated by the _Weizmann Institute_, houses facilities of Israel’s weapons companies _Rafael_ and _Elbit_ among others[^28]. Some examples of military technologies used in past offensives on the Gaza strip include _Elbit_ and _IAI_ drones carrying _Rafael_ missiles, _Elbit_ military aircraft display systems integrated into F-16 fighter jets and Apache helicopters, and Merkava Tanks designed and fitted by _Elbit_ and _Rafael_ in cooperation with the Israeli Ministry of Defense[^28].

Even before October 7th, 2023, Israel was found by the _UN Human Rights Council_ and international human rights organizations to have committed war crimes in all its recent major offensives on the Gaza Strip in 2008–9[^35], 2012[^36], 2014[^37], and 2021[^38]. The soldiers and state personnel that committed these crimes obtained specialized education at Israeli universities. Many of the weapons and technologies that were deployed to commit these crimes were designed and manufactured by Israeli corporations. Yet, the continuous illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and violation of Palestinian human rights has not affected the cooperation of Israeli universities with the military, nor has the use of Israeli military industries’ technology against Palestinian civilians interrupted the collaborations and partnerships with Israel's weapons manufacturers.

## Our demands

We call on the KIT executive board, the KIT senate and the KIT ethics commission to act in accordance with KIT’s own principles, based on the evidence presented above:

1. We demand the suspension of all collaboration agreements with Israeli universities, research centers, and associated research groups that in some form provide specialized education and training for Israeli military personnel, maintain cooperation with Israeli weapons manufacturers and/or their subsidiaries, or are in some other form directly implicated in the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. The necessary proceedings for determining suspension of collaboration are outlined in point 2.
2. We demand the immediate initiation of a review process into all Israeli Universities that KIT and its members have ongoing or planned collaboration agreements with, including partnerships within HorizonEU and other national or international research funding programs. This review process must identify whether causes for suspension outlined in point 1 apply. The review process must be open to the public, include the engagement with student initiatives[^40], and be accompanied by a broader discourse across the university on the conditions for future collaborations with Israeli universities and the future policy on ethical academic ties more generally.
3. We demand to temporarily halt all planned research collaborations with Israeli universities immediately until the review process has been completed.
4. As a member of the _Helmholtz_ association, we further see it as _KIT_’s responsibility, that the same ethical principles that guide its own conduct, are also demanded to apply for its _Helmholtz_ partners. _KIT_ should therefore openly call for suspending research collaborations between _Helmholtz_ and Israeli universities that violate its own ethical principles.

Universities should above all focus on the evidence and take seriously the reports and findings of international institutions such as the _UN_. Researchers across _KIT_ support and acknowledge the findings of _UN_ bodies that relate to climate change or the safeguarding of biodiversity, the same acknowledgement should necessarily apply to the _UN_’s findings regarding human rights violations and crimes against humanity. It is in light of the facts documented by an institution like the _UN_, and with the imperative to uphold international law, that we sign this letter and urge _KIT_ to act according to its own principles.
